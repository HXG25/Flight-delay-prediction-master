Flight Delay Prediction System

This project focuses on predicting airline flight delays using machine learning techniques based on historical flight data, weather conditions, and scheduling patterns.
Flight delays cause inconvenience, financial losses, and operational challenges for airlines and passengers. 
This system aims to provide data-driven insights to anticipate potential delays and support decision-making for better travel planning.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze historical flight data to identify delay patterns.
Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a flight being delayed.
Help improve airline scheduling and passenger travel planning.
Enhance overall reliability in air transportation analytics.


📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
Flight schedules (departure & arrival times)
Airports & airline carriers
Weather conditions (temperature, wind, visibility, etc.)
Delay labels (Delayed / On-Time)
